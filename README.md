C-XYZ is an open-source application designed for creating and managing code files, primarily for Java, but also supporting formats like `.json`, `.html`, and simple text files (`.txt`). Built around the **SoraEditor**, it offers an intuitive text-editing experience with optical text enhancement.

Beyond editing, CXYZ includes a file and folder management system, along with a built-in **terminal emulator** for executing commands and handling file operations directly. There are also **special predefined commands** for enhanced workflow automation.  

Originally released as a **Sketchware project** on the *Sketchub* platform on **February 2, 2021**, CXYZ was later made available as `.swb` files for *Sketchware Pro* and *Mod* users.
